I employed data cleaning, exploratory analysis to drive targeted content strategies, emphasizing high-engagement categories and continuous improvement for business impact.

The solution achieved project objectives by leveraging insights from data analysis. Prioritizing fashion and food content capitalized on audience interests, driving higher engagement. Encouraging interactions in fitness and health categories addressed lower engagement areas. Diversifying content ensured broad appeal, while ongoing analysis facilitated continuous improvement in content strategy.

In this portfolio project, I utilized Python and statistical methods to analyze social media data. Through meticulous cleaning and exploratory analysis, I uncovered audience engagement trends. The insights derived informed targeted marketing strategies, showcasing my problem-solving skills and analytical rigor.
